# üî¨ Integrated Optoelectronic Sensing Device: PCB and Circuit Design for Biophotonic Signal Acquisition

## üìù Project Overview
This project involves designing and building a portable PCB-based fluorescence biosensor. The system integrates an LED excitation source, an optical filter, a photodiode detector, an analog front-end for signal conversion and amplification, and a microcontroller data processing. It measures fluorescence from a standard fluorophore (fluorescein) to demonstrate signal detection, hardware integration, and embedded programming. The focus is on electrical and computer engineering aspects (PCB layout, mixed-signal IC design, signal processing) while connecting to biomedical sensing applications for the purpose of exploring optical and semiconductor engineering. 

## *Ô∏è‚É£ Motivation
This project grew out of my interest in applying electrical and computer engineering to real-world challenges where technology can improve lives. I set out to design a system that highlights my skills in PCB layout, embedded hardware, and signal acquisition, while also demonstrating how these tools can extend into biomedical applications. I was especially drawn to the physics of light and its role in sensing, which bridges core ECE concepts with biophotonics. Although biomedical engineering is not my primary background, I see it as an area where ECE has unique potential to make a human impact. Having had family members affected by cancer, I am particularly motivated to explore projects that, even indirectly, advance technologies for better monitoring, diagnosis, or treatment. This work reflects my goal of integrating hardware design, programming, and data analysis into systems that both strengthen my engineering foundations and illustrate the broader relevance of ECE in improving health outcomes.

## *Ô∏è‚É£ Structure
The repository is organized around a Progress‚ÄìChallenges‚ÄìGoals (PCG) framework that captures the iterative nature of engineering research and design. Each week is documented in a separate folder. Daily entries outline the specific tasks completed (Progress), the obstacles encountered (Challenges), and the objectives set for the next stage (Goals). This structure reflects how projects evolve through cycles of troubleshooting and refinement while also making the workflow transparent to future collaborators or reviewers. By breaking the work into weekly segments, the repository not only tracks technical development but also provides a narrative of how design choices were shaped over time.
