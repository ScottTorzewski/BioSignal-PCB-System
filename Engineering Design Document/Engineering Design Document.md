## Rationale
Studying analog/mixed-signal (AMS) design is crucial for biotechnology applications because it enbales the precise and efficient processing of delicate biological signals. These signals are often extremely weak and operate within noisy physiological environments, which presents a challenge for detection and analysis. Optical analog front-end circuits are the first point of contact for the raw, continous data from our physical world and play a critical role in determining the system sensitivity and accuracy before the signal is converted to the digital domain. 

At a higher-level, exploring AMS design is essential for bioprocessing systems because it enables the development of high-performance sensors needed for real-time monitoring and control. As an engineer in the biopharmaceuitcal manufacturing industry, I am constanty exposed to Process Analytical Technology (PAT) such as the RamanRxN4, a high-performance Raman spectroscopy system that includes a specialized bIO-PRO probe for sterile integration with bioreactors.  As biprocessing shifts towards this data-driven paradigm, AMS technology provides the electronics that can accurately acquire sensor signals within challenging bioreactor enviornments.
