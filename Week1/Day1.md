## ðŸ“ˆ Progress
As with any project, I began by simply reading up on the topic of portable fluorescence biosensors. The two papers I reviewed are "Reviewâ€”Recent Progress in Portable
Fluorescence Sensors" and "Fluorescence-Based Portable Assays for Detection of Biological and Chemical Analytes." My main concers were understanding the biological principles involved in this project. There are several key objectives presented with this technology. First, it is used for the sensitive detection of specific molecules and biological events based on the presence of fluorphores. Additionally, it is useful for the real-time monitoring of dynamic processes while preserving the biological structure. Furthermore, "the popularity of fluorescence assays is due to their high sensitivity, specificity, fast operation, and the availability of diverse types of fluorophores that absorb and emit light covering a broad spectrum of wavelengths from ultraviolet to infrared" (1). Next, as with any technology, we strive for optimization. The idea of minitaurizing biosensors allows them to be portable devices that can be used in locations other than hospitals and treatment centers. However, "although technologies in benchtop fluorescent instruments are well-established and advanced, challenges still exist in applying them to a fully portable fluorescence sensing system ecause most of the conventional fluorescence sensing instruments(especially spectrometers) require complicated optical components and systems, which makes them expensive, large, and high-powerconsuming" (2). 

The electronics design of this portable fluorescent biosensor will require 5 main components:

  1. Optical Excitation Source
  2. Optical Filter
  3. Photodetector
  4. Analog Front-End
  5. Microcontroller

## ðŸ§© Challenges
Challenges presented included interpreting the scientific papers so my level of understanding of the science and technology was sufficient for the design and implementation of this device. 


## ðŸ¥… Goals
By the end of this week, I would like to have researched and selected all of the electronic components I require, develop a system-level block diagram, and create a prelimiary PCB schematic. For each component, I plan to explore the physics of how they operate to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this device as one cohesive unit. Tomorrow, I plan to draft the full requirements list and test-plan.
